# README (Firmware)

Since the TOM firmware is a property of the ICAS Research Group and contains a few NDA requiring libraries, I am not able to share the full source code. I will however be explaining it in detail below and sharing my portion of the code necessary for this project. 

Please see the section on firmware in the `README.md` at the repo root directory for the detailed explanation.
